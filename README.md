# About This Repository

This repo is dedicated to carrying out the work Maxton started on Rock Band 4 customs, and ensuring that access to Rock Band 4 customs are always available. We will also be monitoring for any possible improvements to work he started. 

Everything below (unless noted otherwise) is the original description written by Maxton. 

=================================================================================================================


I am keeping track of my research into RB4 customs here.

I am working out the structure of the files in Rock Band 4. These are being documented in the form of 010 Editor Template files, which are in the `010` directory.

# Latest Build

Can be downloaded at [Appveyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/RG-Tools/libforge) (Note: AppVeyor link changed to match this repo)

# LibForge

This is a library I'm working on that handles reading, writing, and converting for formats in the Forge engine used by Rock Band 4 and Rock Band VR.

It is licensed under the GNU LGPLv3 and includes two frontends at the moment:
